Tentative title: *Probabilistic mapping of the sub-cellular proteome*

**Short bio**: Laurent is an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics at the
de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, in Belgium. His research group focuses
on the development and application of statistical learning for the
analysis and comprehension of large scale biological data. Since 2010,
he has focused on the processing and analysis of mass
spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data in general, and
spatial proteomics data in particular. The development and publication
of scientific software is an integral part of his work, as reflected
by his numerous contributions to the Bioconductor project. Laurent is
an avid open research advocate, making his research outputs openly
available. He is a Software Sustainability Institute fellow, a Data
and Software Carpentry instructor and an ASAPbio ambassador.

**Abstract**: In biology, localisation is function - understanding the
sub-cellular localisation of proteins is paramount to comprehend the
context and full extend of their functions. Shotgun mass
spectrometry-based spatial proteomics method are orthogonal to widely
used targeted microscopy-based assay. In conjunction with contemporary
machine learning, the former enable to build proteome-wide protein
localisation maps, informing us on the location of thousands of
proteins. When studying these proteome-wide spatial maps, one can
learn that while some proteins can be found in a single location
within a cell, up to half of the proteins may reside in multiple
locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown
functional compartment, leading to considerable uncertainty in
associating proteins to their sub-cellular location. Recent Bayesian
modelling approaches enable us to mine these data, and in particular
the dynamic fraction of the spatial proteome, in much greater
depth. We are now in a position to (1) probabilistically model protein
localisation as well as quantify the uncertainty in the location
assignments, and (2) compute a probability for, and quantify
uncertainty in, whether a protein is differentially localised upon
cellular perturbation. These computational approaches lead to better
and more trustworthy biological interpretation of these rich spatial
proteomics data.
