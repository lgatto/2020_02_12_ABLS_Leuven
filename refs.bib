	the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis

	of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar
	membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel

    abstract = {Author summary Sub-cellular localisation of proteins provides insights into sub-cellular biological processes. For a protein to carry out its intended function it must be localised to the correct sub-cellular environment, whether that be organelles, vesicles or any sub-cellular niche. Correct sub-cellular localisation ensures the biochemical conditions for the protein to carry out its molecular function are met, as well as being near its intended interaction partners. Therefore, mis-localisation of proteins alters cell biochemistry and can disrupt, for example, signalling pathways or inhibit the trafficking of material around the cell. The sub-cellular distribution of proteins is complicated by proteins that can reside in multiple micro-environments, or those that move dynamically within the cell. Methods that predict protein sub-cellular localisation often fail to quantify the uncertainty that arises from the complex and dynamic nature of the sub-cellular environment. Here we present a Bayesian methodology to analyse protein sub-cellular localisation. We explicitly model our data and use Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. We find our method is competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods and additionally provides uncertainty quantification. We show that, with this additional information, we can make deeper insights into the fundamental biochemistry of the cell.},

  abstract      = "Understanding sub-cellular protein localisation is an
		   essential component to analyse context specific protein
		   function. Recent advances in quantitative mass-spectrometry
		   (MS) have led to high resolution mapping of thousands of
		   proteins to sub-cellular locations within the cell. Novel
		   modelling considerations to capture the complex nature of
		   these data are thus necessary. We approach analysis of
		   spatial proteomics data in a non-parametric Bayesian
		   framework, using mixtures of Gaussian process regression
		   models. The Gaussian process regression model accounts for
		   correlation structure within a sub-cellular niche, with each
		   mixture component capturing the distinct correlation
		   structure observed within each niche. Proteins with a priori
		   labelled locations motivate using semi-supervised learning
		   to inform the Gaussian process hyperparameters. We moreover
		   provide an efficient Hamiltonian-within-Gibbs sampler for
		   our model. Furthermore, we reduce the computational burden
		   associated with inversion of covariance matrices by
		   exploiting the structure in the covariance matrix. A tensor
		   decomposition of our covariance matrices allows extended
		   Trench and Durbin algorithms to be applied it order to
		   reduce the computational complexity of inversion and hence
		   accelerate computation. A stand-alone R-package implementing
